DPS Panels
==========

This is a set of Panels that are helpers for tricks and workarounds when authoring content with the Adobe Digital Publishing Suite.

The panels work with InDesign CS6.

Authors
-------

These panels (currently one) is based [on a blog post by Johannes Henseler](http://digitalpublishing.tumblr.com/post/10161880827/creating-super-overlays-that-overlay-other). To make the process more easily, a panel comes in handy.
The script in the first panel (Create Superoverlay) was vastly improved by Uwe Laubender.
